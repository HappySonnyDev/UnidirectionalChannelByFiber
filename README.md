## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements

- Node.js 22.19 or higher
- pnpm (recommended) or npm/yarn
- CKB Devnet environment (started with offckb) - see installation step 3

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dapp_2
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start CKB Devnet Node**
   ```bash
   # Use offckb to start local CKB development network
   offckb node
   ```
   
   > **Note**: Make sure [offckb](https://github.com/RetricSu/offckb) is installed. If not, run:
   > ```bash
   > npm install -g @offckb/cli
   > ```
   > 
   > The node runs on `http://localhost:28114` by default. Keep this terminal window running.

4. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Create `.env.local` file in packages/webapp directory:
   ```env
   # Local Ollama Configuration
   OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
   OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5:0.5b
   
   # CKB Blockchain Configuration
   SELLER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xxxxxxxxxxxxx     # Seller (server-side) private key
   
   # JWT Secret (for authentication)
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
   

5. **Initialize database**
   
   The database will be created automatically on first run. 
   
   > **Note for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) users with Node.js 22+**:
   > 
   > If you encounter the error "Could not locate the bindings file" for better-sqlite3, you need to rebuild it from source:
   > 
   > ```bash
   > # Navigate to better-sqlite3 package directory
   > cd node_modules/.pnpm/better-sqlite3@12.4.1/node_modules/better-sqlite3
   > 
   > # Ensure build tools are available
   > xcode-select --install || true
   > python3 --version
   > 
   > # Rebuild from source
   > npm_config_python="$(command -v python3)" \
   > npm_config_build_from_source=true \
   > npx node-gyp rebuild
   > 
   > # Return to project root
   > cd -
   > ```
   > 
   > This issue occurs because prebuilt binaries are not available for the Node.js 22 + ARM64 combination.

6. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   
   ```
   
   **Additional commands**:
   ```bash
   # Build all packages
   pnpm build
   
   # Build contracts only
   pnpm build:contracts
   
   # Test contracts
   pnpm test:contracts
   
   # Deploy contracts to devnet
   pnpm deploy:contracts
   ```

7. **Access the application**
   
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## 💡 User Guide

### 1. User Login

- Enter your CKB private key in the login form on the main page
- Click "Login" to complete login

> **Security Notice**: 
> - 🔒 **We never send your private key to the server** - private keys are processed locally on the client only
> - 🔑 Only the public key derived from your private key is sent to the server for identity verification
> - 💾 **For demonstration purposes**: Private keys are stored in browser's localStorage
> - 🚫 **Do not use this storage method in production environments**
>
> **Get test accounts**:
> ```bash
> # View available test accounts (requires offckb node to be running)
> offckb accounts
> ```
> Choose a private key from one of the accounts for testing.

### 2. Create Payment Channel

- After successful authentication, go to "Payment Channels" tab
- Click "Create New Channel"
- Set channel parameters:
  - **Amount**: Funding amount (CKB)
  - **Duration**: Channel validity period (days)
- Click "Create Channel" to create the channel
- Wait for on-chain confirmation, then channel status becomes "Active"

### 3. Activate Payment Channel

- In the payment channel list, click "Confirm Funding"
- The system will automatically submit funding transaction to CKB network
- After confirmation, channel becomes "Active" status
- Set as default channel to start using

### 4. Chat with AI and Pay

- Return to the main page and start chatting with AI assistant
- Enable "Auto Pay" switch for automatic payment
- Each AI response generates data chunks
- Payment status panel shows:
  - Current consumed Tokens
  - Remaining Tokens
  - Payment record list
- View transaction details for each payment

### 5. Settle Payment Channel

- In Payment Channels, select the channel to settle
- Click "Settle Channel"
- The system will submit the last payment transaction to the blockchain
- After successful settlement, remaining funds are returned to the buyer's address

> **Note**: For demonstration, we added settlement functionality on the client side. In practice, the server also runs a scheduled task that automatically settles channels nearing expiration.

## 🔧 Admin Features

Visit [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin) to access the admin dashboard (requires admin privileges)

### Feature Modules

- **User Management**: View all users, disable/enable users
- **Payment Channel Management**: View all channels, force settlement, modify status
- **Scheduled Task Management**: 
  - Auto-settle channels expiring within 15 minutes
  - Check and mark expired channels (mainly to allow client UI to withdraw deposits; even without this scheduled task, you can still extract deposits using transaction data after expiration)
  - View task execution logs

## 📊 Database Structure

### Main Tables

1. **users** - User table
   - Stores user information, public keys, associated addresses

2. **payment_channels** - Payment channel table
   - Channel ID, amount, status, timestamps
   - Signature data, transaction data

3. **chunk_payments** - Chunk-level payment records
   - Chunk ID, token count, payment status
   - Transaction data, buyer signatures

4. **task_logs** - Scheduled task log table
   - Task execution records, status, results

## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ Private keys processed client-side only, never sent to server
- ✅ JWT-based secure authentication
- ✅ Payment channels protected by multi-signature scripts
- ✅ All transactions require buyer and seller signatures
- ✅ Relative time locks protect refund transactions

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### Spilman Payment Channel

Spilman channel is a type of unidirectional payment channel that allows buyers to make multiple payments to sellers, but only requires final settlement on-chain once:

1. **Creation Phase**: 
   - Buyer creates funding transaction to lock funds
   - Seller signs refund transaction (with timelock)
   
2. **Payment Phase**:
   - Buyer signs new payment transactions to update allocation
   - Seller holds the latest payment transaction
   
3. **Settlement Phase**:
   - Seller submits the last payment transaction to blockchain
   - Or buyer can refund after timeout

### Chunk-level Payment Flow

1. User sends message to AI assistant
2. AI starts streaming response data
3. When each data chunk arrives:
   - Calculate chunk token count
   - Calculate cumulative payment amount
   - Construct and sign payment transaction
   - Send to server for verification
4. Server validates signature and stores
5. Frontend updates payment status

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Wallet connection failed**
- Check if private key format is correct (needs 0x prefix)
- Ensure the private key's corresponding address has sufficient CKB balance

**Q: Payment channel creation failed**
- Check if CKB node is running properly
- Verify seller private key and address configuration
- Check browser console and server logs

**Q: AI chat no response**
- Check if OPENAI_API_KEY is configured correctly
- Ensure network connection is stable
- Check if API quota is exhausted

**Q: Scheduled tasks not executing**
- Go to admin dashboard to check task status
- Manually start tasks for testing
- Review task execution logs
